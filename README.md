# Compacted_Soil_Recovery
This project aims to model the recovery of compacted soils by incorporating three different organic materials. Four predictors were used for this predictive analysis, which comprises of moisture content, organic matter level, soil compaction level, organic matter type and soil type. 
Three samples of soil types were incorperated each with three samples of organic matter types. The aim of the Maiduguri based project is to determine which soil is better and suitable for crops on the basis of the recovery.
This Project was carried out in University of Maiduguri, Borno State, Nigeria.
